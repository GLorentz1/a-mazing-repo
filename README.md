This is a simple side project in which I explored some maze generation algorithms just for the fun of it. 

I initially tried using TDD but I eventually gave up on the idea because the tests were becoming really repetitive (that's probably my fault but hey, this is just a side project).

There are (up to now) 4 different algorithms for generating mazes and 3 algorithms for solving them.
